# Mobilighter

Mobilighter is a lightweight sub-project that that bridges some basic user interface (and not only) details between Android and iOS platforms. It lets you dive deeper into your platform independent coding with less need to do platform specific things.

For now it is just a part of SQLighter/AmfibiaN demo, but should separate into a dedicated github project some time in the near future.
