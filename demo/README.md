### Demo projects

Note: demo is under construction. You can look at proj. structure and code samples
but I do not guarantee it will compile and run out of the box on your computer
due to path configurations.

## iOS

Look into to crt-link-j2objc.sh for an example on how to create a link
to j2objc distribution into the demo directory. iOS project refers
this location for includes and lib paths.
